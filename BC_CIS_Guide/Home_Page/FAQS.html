    <li><b>I've heard a lot of conflicting
opinions about the job and career
prospects in computing. I need
accurate information. Are jobs
available, and does computing make
sense as a lifetime career? Where can I
learn more about this subject?</b></li>
<p>
  Yes, there are jobs available in computing.
Even when the number of jobs in the field
was at its lowest point in 2002-03, there
was less unemployment in the Information
Technology sector than in the overall U.S.
economy.
Today, there is increasing demand for
computing professionals, and a significant
shortage of skilled personnel. Thus there is
great opportunity for our graduates. Many
people who start out in IT jobs move into
managerial positions in their organizations.
The key to any successful career, including
a computing career, is keeping up with the
field and continuing education throughout
your working years. An excellent source for
information about computing careers is at
http://computingcareers.acm.org. Look at
the Frequently Asked Questions on that site
for detailed answers to many of your
questions about the computing job and
career situation.

    <li><b>Which introductory course should the
student who intends to major in CIS
take?</b></li>
<p>
  A student who intends to major in CIS
should start by taking CISC 1115,
Introduction to Computing Using Java.
CISC 1115 is an introduction to
programming, using the Java programming
language. The programming assignments
do not assume that the student has a
mathematical background beyond high
school mathematics. The Java language is
used heavily in later courses in the
curriculum, as well as in industry.
There are currently two versions of CISC
1115. One section emphasizes scientific
applications, and is intended for students
interested in STEM fields (Science,
Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics). Only students in the
Coordinated Engineering Program or
Science/Math Majors (not Computer
Science) who have completed pre calculus
or been placed in Calculus I may take this
section. All other students should enroll in
any of the other sections. The standard
version of CISC 1115 is not geared to a
particular application area, but rather uses
examples from a variety of fields.
  </p>
    <li><b>What are those other introductory
courses?</b></li>
  <p>
    The department offers several other
  introductory courses, but they are not
  appropriate first courses for a CIS major.
  They are:
  • CISC 1000, Computing: Its Nature,
  Power and Limits
  • CISC 1001, Computing and Quantitative
  Reasoning
  • CISC 1002, The Outer Limits of
  Reasoning
  • CISC 1003, Exploring Robotics
  • CISC 1050, Introduction to Computer
  Applications.
  CISC 1000 is designed for students who do
  not intend to major in CIS or in the
  sciences. CISC 1001, 1002, and 1003 fulfill
  Pathways requirements. CISC 1050, which
  can be taken by a CIS major, teaches office
  applications like Windows, Word, Excel,
  Access, and Powerpoint.
  Students can take CISC 1050 in the same
  semester as CISC 1115.

  <li><b>
    Where can I learn C++?
  </b></li>
  <p>
    CISC 3142 teaches advanced
programming concepts in C++.
    </p>
    <li><b>
      How should I prepare myself for
graduate school in computer science?
    </b></li>
    <p>
      A student intending to go to graduate
school in computer science should take
CISC 3220, CISC 3390, and CISC 3230. It
is also a good idea to take as many CIS
electives as possible, and to do a research
project with a CIS faculty member for CISC
4900, 4940, 4945, 4950, 4955, 5001 or
5002. If you plan to take the Graduate
Record Exam in computer science, you
should complete CISC 3230 before taking
the exam.
      </p>
      <li><b>
        How can I learn other programming
languages besides Java and C++?
    </b></li>
    <p>
      You may take CISC 3160 which includes
an introduction to other languages. You
may also take a CIS course numbered
between1150 and 1200 to learn a specific
new language.
      </p>
      <li><b>
        Who should consider entering a
computer-related profession?
      </b></li>
      <p>
        Most importantly, you should be
interested!–either in the computer per se, or
in the enormous variety of applications to
which it is put. If you’re interested in a
career involving programming, you should
find programming interesting and (mostly)
fun. If you enjoy solving puzzles and
complex problems, you may find
programming work very satisfying. Of
course, it helps to be orderly and
disciplined in your approach—when dealing
with machines, nothing useful can be
achieved by vague or fuzzy thinking;
similarly, you should be comfortable with
doing painstaking, detailed-oriented tasks.
It is not necessary to have extensive
32
mathematical knowledge for most
professional programmer jobs, and many
have entered the field with undergraduate
majors in such diverse areas as
psychology, history, English literature, etc.
But an undergraduate degree in computer
science can be a very solid foundation.

      <li><b>
        Do I need a grade of C or better in
every single CIS course to complete
the major?
      </b></li>
      <p>
        No. You need a grade of C or better in 24
advanced elective credits at Brooklyn
College for the B.S. in Computer and
Information Science. All courses not
marked with an asterisk in Section IV or in
the Bulletin are advanced electives. You
need a C or better in any course that is a
prerequisite to any other CIS course. For
example, you need a C in CISC 3130, since
it is a prerequisite for CISC 3142, but you
do not need a C or better in CISC 3180
(because it is not a prerequisite for
anything), as long as you have 24 other
advanced electives with a grade of C or
better.
See the Mathematics department about
grade requirements for mathematics
courses

        <b>
          Can an undergraduate student take a
graduate course?
        </b>
        <p>
          Advanced (senior year) students with good
records can consider taking a CIS graduate
course as an advanced elective, if they
satisfy the prerequisite conditions. This
requires the approval of both the
department and the Academic Advisement
Center. See the Graduate Student
Counselor. A large variety of graduate
courses are offered every semester,
including courses in artificial intelligence,
databases, and computer networks.

            What second course(s) should be
taken by a CIS major?
          </b>
          <p>
            CISC 2210 (Introduction to Discrete
            Structures) and CISC 3115 Introduction to
            Modern Programming Techniques) are
            good second courses. CISC 3115
            31
            continues the study of Java programming
            and also introduces the student to the study
            of data structures. This course includes
            substantial programming assignments.
            CISC 2210 covers some of the
            mathematical and logical constructs that
            underlie computing. CISC 2210 has a
            prerequisite of MATH 1011 or placement
            into MATH 1201 by the Math Department.
